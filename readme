Minesweeper AI:

This was a fun little project. It works as long as its sure that a bomb is at a particular position.

To make it better, one could implement some sort of system that takes in information about many squares at once,
to figure out if a bomb MUST be there or not. It won't be easy. But it IS possible.

Best of luck, I'm done with this for now. I hope to come back to it with more knowledge.
